ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Leica M10-R is the latest revision of the company's M-mount rangefinder camera. With a 40MP sensor, it's the highest resolution M-series camera yet (as of July 2020), and Leica claims that it offers more dynamic range and less noise than previous models. It has the same ultra-quiet shutter of other recent M models, and can now take exposures as long as 16 minutes.The large, bright line viewfinder has automatic parallax correction and a magnification of 0.73x. A 3" touchscreen display offers a modern interface. Wi-Fi (2.4Ghz) is built in, but Bluetooth is not. As with all Leica cameras, build quality is first rate.
