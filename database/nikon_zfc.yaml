ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Z fc is an Z-mount mirrorless camera with a design reminiscent of the company's film cameras, such as the FM2. The top plate is loaded with dials and also has a small screen that displays the current aperture. The Z fc has a hybrid AF system with 209 phase-detect points, along with face and eye detection, for both people and animals. The camera can capture 4K/30p video plus high speed 120 fps footage at Full HD. The Z fc has a fully articulating 1.04M-dot LCD as well as a 2.36M-dot EVF. It supports USB Power Delivery, which allows the camera to be operated when connected to a laptop charger or power brick. It has a single SD card slot and uses the same EN-EL25 battery as the Z50.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those looking for a light, inexpensive and stylish ILC with direct controls and vlogging-friendly features.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who prefer a more substantial-feeling body, best-in-class autofocus or a wider selection of native lenses.
        Conclusion: The Nikon Z fc is an APS-C mirrorless camera that successfully brings back the design of the company's film cameras. It offers plenty of hands-on controls, a vlogger-friendly fully articulating touchscreen, excellent still and video quality, and plenty of customizability. It could use refinement in a few areas, but for those looking for an eye-catching camera that can capture the moment for social media and more, the Z fc is a solid choice.
