ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The A3000 uses the same sensor format that Sony builds into its full-sized Alpha DSLR cameras, including the same adaptive noise reduction technology from their flagship A99. The A3000 is compatible with Sony's growing selection of E-mount lenses; smaller, lighter and designed specifically for Sony's compact interchangeable lens cameras (NEX). Aimed for beginning users who prefer the look and feel of a traditional DSLR, it provides a built-in electronic viewfinder. At its introduction the A3000 costs less than any other interchangeable lens camera on the market, though the trade-off in low-cost components is evident.
