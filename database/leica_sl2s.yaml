ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Leica SL2 is a 24 Megapixel stills/video hybrid full-frame camera that uses the L-mount that the company co-developed with Panasonic and Sigma. It has sensor-shift image stabilization built right in, and the camera can move the sensor in order to produce 96 Megapixel images. The SL2-S's body is built like a tank and has an IP54 certification for weather-sealing. The camera's touchscreen LCD is 3.2" in size and sports 2.1 million dots, while the large EVF has a resolution of 5.76 million dots. The SL2-S has two SD card slots, both of which are compatible with high-speed UHS-II media. A small LCD on the top plate lets you quickly view and adjust camera settings.The SL2-S can capture DCI and UHD 4K video at 60 frames/sec (with an APS-C crop; it's 30p without one) and up to 180 fps in Full HD mode. The SL2-S has both mic and headphone sockets, as well as a full-size HDMI port. Waveforms, color bars with a test tone and automatic follow-focus will be added in 2021.
