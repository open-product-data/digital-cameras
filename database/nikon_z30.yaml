    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Vlogging, streaming and social media content.
        NotSoGoodFor: Advanced video production or stills photographers (you're better off with the Z50, which has an EVF).
        Conclusion: The Nikon Z30 is clearly designed with content creators in mind, particularly those intending to film vlogging-style content. It captures 4K/30p video from the full width of the sensor and 1080p video at 120 fps. Lens options are sparse, but it's paired with a respectable 16-50mm (24-70mm equiv) vibration reduction (VR) kit lens that's great for casual run-and-gun shooting. It will work for casual still images, but you're probably better off going with the Z50 for stills photography considering it has an EVF.
