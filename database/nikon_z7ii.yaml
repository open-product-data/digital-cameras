ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Z7 II supplants the original Z7 as the highest-resolution model in the Z-series mirrorless lineup. Offering a 46MP full-frame sensor, in-camera 5-axis stabilization and high-quality 4K video shooting, the Z7 II provides a similar feature set to its predecessor, but with some differences. Improvements include (and mostly stem from) the addition of a second Expeed 6 image processor, which allows for faster continuous shooting (now up to 10fps) improved autofocus and 4k/60p video with a modest crop. Physically the Z7 II is almost identical to the original Z7, but now features twin CFe / SD card slots, and provision for a vertical control grip (available separately).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Landscape photography and portraiture
        NotSoGoodFor: Demanding action shooting, regular changes of subject type
        Conclusion: The Z7 II is a very capable all-rounder, boosted by the addition of twin card slots and the option to add a battery grip. It offers superb image quality, solid autofocus and good video specs. But it's only really its slightly lower price that makes it stand out from a very competitive group. Thoroughly likable.
