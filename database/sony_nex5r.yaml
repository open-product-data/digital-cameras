ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 16MP Sony NEX-5R is a meaty update to its predecessor the 5N. It gains a control dial and dedicated function button, Wi-Fi capabilities and the ability to run proprietary in-camera apps to extend its capabilities. The biggest technology advance on the NEX-5R however, is the addition of a modified sensor with pixels devoted to performing phase-detection to provide a hybrid autofocus system. The phase-detection pixels are used to determine depth information about the focus target, which means the camera has to perform less hunting.
