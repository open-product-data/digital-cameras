ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 16MP Sony NEX-5T is marginally updated from its predecessor, with the addition of NFC connectivity. It has a control dial, dedicated function button and the ability to run proprietary in-camera apps to extend its capabilities. It retains its predecessor's live view focusing technology, using a modified sensor with pixels devoted to performing phase-detection to provide a hybrid autofocus system. The phase-detection pixels are used to determine depth information about the focus target, which means the camera has to perform less hunting. Other key features includes its 180° tilt-able touch-screen LCD for easy self-portraits, DSLR-like AF tracking for shooting at up to 10 fps, one-touch sharing, and one-touch remote (for NFC-enabled devices).
